DATA
----
A pre-release version of Urdu Dependency Treebank is being released now. UDTB is a multi-layered dependency treebank with morphological, part-of-speech and dependency annotations on sentences from news domain corpus acquired from newspaper agency Siasat and other news agencies. During annotation, the dependency relations are only marked between chunks in the sentence and the words are annotated with POS tags and morphological analysis. The annotations are stored in the Shakti Standard Format (See $parent_dir/docs/ssf-guide.pdf for a detailed description of the format). An automatic tool is then used on the inter-chunk relations as a post-processing step to get the complete dependency tree between words. This is done by first identifying the head word in the chunk and then identifying the intra-chunk relations between words in the chunks. The expanded tree is also stored in SSF without losing the chunk information.

New Expander has been created using ARC-EAGER algorithm (Shift-Reduce Parsing). The new expanded intrachunk UDTB data has been generated using the mentioned expander.


DATA FORMAT
-----------

The data is being released in 4 formats, Inter-Chunk and Intra-Chunk, SSF and CoNLL. For detailed introduction to SSF, please read $parent_dir/docs/ssf-guide.pdf and for an intro to the CoNLL format, go through the link http://ilk.uvt.nl/conll/#dataformat.
